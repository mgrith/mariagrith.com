### About me

I am an Assistant Professor in Econometrics at the Erasmus School of Economics. I received my Ph.D. in Economics in 2013 from the Humboldt University of Berlin. Prior to joining Erasmus, I had postdoctoral appointments at Humboldt University of Berlin, the University of Pennsylvania, and Singapore Management University.

My work is concerned with developing statistical methods to study dynamic high-dimensional data settings and relies on nonparametric statistics, functional data analysis, machine learning, and graphical models. The research applications lie primarily in finance, and I am particularly interested in asset pricing, option pricing, risk management, and digital finance.

This is my [curriculum vitae](M_Grith_Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
