### About me

I am an Associate Professor in the Finance Department of Neoma Business School. I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from Humboldt University of Berlin. Afterward, I held postdoctoral appointments at Humboldt University of Berlin, the University of Pennsylvania, and Singapore Management University. I served as an Assistant Professor in Econometrics at the Erasmus School of Economics.

My work focuses on developing statistical methods for analyzing dynamic high-dimensional data. I utilize nonparametric statistics, functional data analysis, machine learning, and graphical models in my research. My primary applications are in finance, with a particular interest in asset pricing, option pricing, risk management, and digital finance.

This is my [curriculum vitae](M_Grith_Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
